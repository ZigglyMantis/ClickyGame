# ClickyGame

This react minigame was created in order to be submitted as Homework

It has very simple instructions and is rather hard for such a simple game.

Clicking an image will grant the user 1 score

You win by getting 16 score.

If you click the same image twice, you lose and get reset back to zero score.

On every click the images shuffle, making remembering which one you clicked harder.

The game is themed with warframes from the game Warframe.

For legal reasons I do not own the rights to the music or the characters portrayed within this react app.

There are not requirements for this game as it is hosted on Git hub pages

However, if you pull this down and want to use it locally npm install

The main branch should work on most computers locally, file paths might need to be changed, but unlikely.

Requirements: Have fun.
